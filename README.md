## Brief History & Game Play Information
Mancala is one of the world's oldest games, dating back to 1000 BC when it had spread throughout Africa. The word _mancala_ is derived from the Abrabic word _naqala_ (نقلة), which means "to move", referring to the action of moving stones/beads across the board. 

There are many varieties of game play options for mancala. The ruleset used in this version is from the Kahlah variant of the game. 

##### How to play: 
Player indicated chooses a hole from their side. If their last stone lands in their store, they may go again. If the last sone lands in an empty spot on their side, they may "capture" the stones in the opposite hole. Whomever clears their side of the board first gets to keep all the remaining stones in play. Player with the most stones wins.
